Solution can be found: TupleRssFeedExercise/Program.cs

Solution synopsis: Takes tuple datasets, query for feeds that were published a day or less ago, and prints the company name as well as timespan that feed was inactive.

I'm assuming that RSS feed information has already been read and parsed into a data table and it's schema is: Company Name, Article Title, Url, Publish Date, and Article Description.
