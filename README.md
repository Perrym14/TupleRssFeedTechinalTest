## Metabolon Software Engineer- Techinal Test

Solution can be found: TupleRssFeedExercise/Program.cs

### Solution synopsis 
- Takes tuple datasets, query for feeds that were published a day or less ago, and prints the company name as well as timespan that feed was inactive.

- I'm assuming that RSS feed information has already been read and parsed into a data table and it's schema is: 

 Company Name,
 Article Title,
 Url,
 Publish Date,
 Article Description,

### Example

**Input Data**: 

"Hub Tech",

"Best New Tech",

"www.HubTech.com/article/best-new-tech/",

 05/22/2019,
 
 "Article about new tech"

**Output**: "Hub Tech's last updated feed was 2 day(s) ago."
